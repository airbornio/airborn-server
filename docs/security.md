## What we did, or What we can't see

All your files are encrypted with your password before they are uploaded
to us. This means we can't see what's inside or what the files are
called.

Most of the code of Airborn OS is also encrypted and stored with your
files. This means we can't change what your Airborn OS does and shares with
us without your permission (by clicking Update, or by having autoupdating enabled). We say most code
because there also needs to be some unencrypted code which decrypts the
rest of the code. To protect that code as well, you need to install
[this addon][].


## What we didn't do, or What we can see

We can see how large your files are and how many they are. If you store
something with a distinctive filesize or distinctive filesizes, we could
see it.

We don't protect your anonymity. Unless you protect it yourself, we can
see where in the world you're accessing Airborn OS from.
